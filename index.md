# Anime Recommendation Engine

## Motivation
Anime is a form of animated media with origins tied to Japan. A recent Google trend revealed that there are between 10-100M searches for anime related topics every month [cite source]. This number has only just peaked in the month of April [cite source] as a result of nation-wide quarantine orders and subsequent efforts to find an entertainment medium. Our goal is to apply machine learning to recommend the best anime for a user to watch based on their personal favorites. Recommendation engines can be built using the techniques of either collaborative or content-based filtering. Due to the limitations of our dataset, our implementation involved using content-based filtering with a modified KNN. To enhance the model and provide only the best of recommendations, we used a combination of dense, categorical, and textual features.

## Data
### Dataset [explain what features we have, what they represent, graphs, etc]
...
### Pre-processing [techniques we used, cleaning text, one-hot encoding, normalizing, graphs, correlation matrix, word embeddings, talk about correlations, etc]
...

## Modelling & Results
### Modelling [average of the vector representation of each anime, what distance metric was used, etc]
...

### Results [show results of KNN before normalizing/PCA, then after KNN on normalized or PCA'd dataset, show examples of results, no way to validate results]
